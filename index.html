        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now clear that the access record for Individual 1 is inadequate, and that the third
individual is not quite compatible with any type. It should be noted that throughout this
example we have worked with uniform priors. These priors have no canonic justification
but should be regarded as conventional. If specific information justifying other priors
is available, they can easy be used, but this is seldom the case. The choice of prior will
affect the assignment of individual to type in rare cases, but only when the access records
            are very short and when the individual does not really fit to any type.</p>
        <h2>CASE 2: SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH –</h2>
        <h2>CAUSALITY IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This application is directed at understanding a complex system – the human brain
(Hall, Larsson, & Sedvall 1999). Similar methods have been applied to undestanding
complex engineered systems like paper mills, and economic systems. Many investigations on normal subjects have brought immense new knowledge about the normal
function of the human brain, but mental disorders still escape understanding of their
causes and cures (despite a large number of theories, it is not known why mental disorders
develop except in special cases, and it is not known which physiological and/or
psychological processes cause them). In order to get handles on the complex relationships between psychology, psychiatry, and physiology of the human brain, a data base
is being built with many different types of variables measured for a large population of
schizophrenia patients and control subjects. For each volunteering subject, a large
number of variables are obtained or measured, like age, gender, age of admission to
psychiatric care; volumes of gray and white matter and cerebrospinal fluid in several
regions of the brain (obtained from MR images), genetic characterization, and measurements of concentrations in the blood of large numbers of substances and metabolites.
For the affected subjects, a detailed clinical characterization is recorded.
In this application, one can easily get lost. There is an enormous amount of relatively
unorganized knowledge in the medical profession on the relationships and possible
significances of these many variables. At the same time, the data collection process is
costly, so the total number of subjects is very small compared, for example, with national
registers that have millions of persons but relatively few variables for each of them. This
means that statistical significance problems become important. A test set of 144 subjects,
83 controls, and 61 affected by schizophrenia was obtained. This set was investigated
with most methods described in this chapter, giving an understanding of the strongest
relationships (graphical model), possible classifications into different types of the
disease, etc. In order to find possible causal chains, we tried to find variables and variable
pairs with a significant difference in co-variation with the disease, i.e., variables and
tuples of variables whose joint distribution is significantly different for affected person
relative to control subjects. This exercise exhibited a very large number of such variables
and tuples, many of which were known before, others not. All these associations point
to possible mechanisms involved in the disease, which seems to permeate every part of
the organism. Using the methods finding directions of arrows in directed graphical
    models, it turns out that in several cases independent variables like subject’s genotype or  age come out as caused by variables that are dependent, like blood tests or brain region
sizes. This shows that application of causality methods give misleading results in a case
like this, where it is known that many important variables cannot be measured, and are
even not known. Thus it is not generally possible to see which is the effect and what is
the cause, and many of the effects can be related to the strong medication given to all
schizophrenic patients. In order to single out the more promising effects, an undirected
graphical model approach was tried: Each variable was standardized around its mean,
separately for affected and controls, and discretized. Then the pairs of variables were
detected giving the highest probability to the left graph in Figure 4. Here D stands for
the diagnosis (classification of the subject as affected or control), and A and B are the
two variables compared. In the next graph, the relationship can be described as affecting
the two variables independently, whereas in the next model where variables A and D are
swapped, the relationship can be described as the disease affecting one of them but with
a relationship to the other that is the same for affected and for controls. Many of the pairs
selecting the first graph involved some parts of the vermis (a part of cerebellum).
Particularly important was the subject age and posterior superior vermis volume pair. As
shown in Figure 5, this part of the brain decreases in size with age for normal subjects.
But for the affected persons the size is smaller and does not change with age. Neither does
the size depend significantly on the duration of the disease or the medication received.
Although these findings could be explained by confounding effects, the more likely
explanation presently is that the size reduction occured before outbreak of the disease
and that processes leading to the disease involve disturbing the development of this part
of the brain. Several other variables were linked to the vermis in the same way; there was
an association for control subjects but not for the affected ones, indicating that the
normal co-variation is broken by the mechanisms of the disease. For variables that were<p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This chapter emphasized the statistical approach to data mining. Meaning of data
is therefore linked to its properties relative to statistical models. It also emphasizes a
Bayesian approach, mainly because of its intellectual appeal. The techniques proposed
for analytical models and EM classification can be applied to very large data sets,
possibly after small tunings of the “obvious”algorithm. On the other hand, Markov Chain
Monte Carlo methods are not used today on gigantic data sets. The methods described
here are easy to apply using general-purpose software like C, Matlab, Octave, R, etc. An
ongoing development is the adaptation of the simple family of models described here to
large and complex applications. This leads to increased complexity. In the Bayesian
paradigm, increasing complexity means using more detailed models and more application-specific assumptions in prior distributions. But this is also a complete description
of what can be done, besides improving performance by careful implementation and
integration, and carefully selected approximate computational methods.</p>
